# Project 1: #

## Web Programming with Python and JavaScript ##

 This is a very much learnable process I pass last ten days.This project goal are
    1. Become more comfortable with Python. 
    2. Gain experience with Flask. 
    3. Learn to use SQL to interact with databases.
	I think it is successful. I try to avoid  SQLAlchemy ORM and my import cvs books file is done by using raw SQL commands. This is a book review web application. Users able to register for application and then log in using their username and password. Once they log in, they will be able to search for books, leave reviews for individual books, and see the reviews made by other people. it is also use the a third-party API by Goodreads, another book review website, to pull in ratings from a broader audience. Finally, users will be able to query for book details and book reviews programmatically via applicationâ€™s API.
